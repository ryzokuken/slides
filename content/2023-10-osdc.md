## OSDC

-   Orientation: first round of introductions
-   Team buildup: 4 + ~8
-   Got involved: Gitter and osdc-bot
-   Discussions with CT and onboarding
-   Introduction to serious OSS and community organization

---

## Lesson #1

> Don't ask to volunteer.

---

## Hacktoberfest 🎃

-   Hacktoberfest 2016 announced shortly afterwards
-   3 PRs = 1 👕
-   Decided to make it a challenge, started scoping orgs
-   Publiclab
-   Deeper integration, getting serious

---

## Lesson #2

> Don't always go for the low-hanging fruit, challenge yourself. You might be surprised.

---

## GSoC

-   Many interesting projects posed, but I had other plans
-   Took a gamble, proposed a fresh project: plotsbot
-   Thrust into the real-world complexities of software architecture
-   Tried a modular approach, reinvented webpack configs
-   A mix of familiar subjects in unfamiliar contexts helped me learn a lot and the project was a success

---

## The plateau of mediocrity

-   Spent some time destressing and built on my strengths
-   Picked up some projects, started getting comfortable
-   "This is it, right?"
-   Confronted the problem, got a wake-up call, support systems
-   Broke the spell: GSoC mentoring, DevOps and Node.js

---

## Lesson #3

> Being alone sucks, surround yourself with amazing people.

---

## Node 🐢

-   Came across a prominent Node.js collaborator on Twitter
-   Started diving into the docs and picking up tiny issues
-   Gained confidence, worked on bigger tasks, became a collaborator
-   Attended the Node.js Collaborator Summit in Berlin, JSConf EU
-   The beginning of everything, made my first few proper "connections"

---

## The conference circuit

-   JSConf EU was arguably one of the best conferences of all time
-   After a lot of grinding, I managed to start getting invited
-   The constraints of conference attendance in university
-   Developing a network and getting recognition for work

---

## Lesson #4

> Go out, explore. You don't know what you don't know.

---

## V8 and Compilers

-   Met V8 team in Summer 2018
-   Started getting serious about runtime/embedding
-   Took the time to onboard onto various V8 components: embedding, frontend, optimizations, torque
-   Joined the Electron embedding team
-   Built the foundation of my actual career

---

## Job search

-   Mutable internship
-   PPO, FT and the woes of having your neck under a boot
-   "The plan"
-   Execution, failure and desperation
-   A glimmer of hope

---

## Lesson #5

> The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell.
>
> ― Imagine Dragons

---

## Igalia

-   Started with Compilers CE, worked on Cranelift backend
-   "The internals"
-   Growing interesting in Temporal, applied for a role in the team
-   Onboarded, part-time, Temporal shennanigans
-   Lockdown, "forced" prioritization
-   Rediscovering Intl, growing into standards work, leadership

---

## Beyond

-   End of lockdown, the move, return to in-person events
-   The deep end of standardization: IETF, TC39 and Unicode
-   Contentment
-   The need to continue challenging yourself
-   A mix of optimism and software activism
