## Wait, who are you again?

* ECMA TC39
  * Standardizing ~ECMAScript~ JavaScript
  * Google, Microsoft, Bloomberg, PayPal, …
* Temporal Champions Group
  * Standardizing `Date`
  * Modern, ergonomic API for building date/time applications
  * JavaScript veterans, Internationalization experts, …

---

## History

* Number of non-standard "zoned timestamp" formats
* Temporal needs to add calendars to the mix
* Champions designed a format inspired by BCP 47
* Presented to CalConnect/ISO and CALEXT
* [Presented to DISPATCH in IETF 110](https://ryzokuken.dev/slides/2021-03-ietf/)
* Follow-up discussions led to SEDATE

# What changed?

* Initially came with a very ambitious proposal
* More realistic goals now
* Builds on top of 3339, updates **out-of-scope**
* Temporal is Stage 3, implementations ongoing
* In conversations with ISO for liason
* Draft underwent another round of reviews

## Why is this context useful?

* Operations on an instant relies on context
* The current model either assumes:
  * No Information (Bad)
  * UTC or ISO Calendar (Worse)
* `now + 5 h` depends on the timezone
* `now + 5 mo` depends on the calendar

---

## Why this syntax?

* The suffix should be optional
* Time zone suffix from Java for compatibility
* Generalized format inspired by BCP 47
  * Namespaced in order to keep the RFC focussed
  * Borrowed the IANA Registry pattern
  * `key-value` replaced with `key=value` for parsing
* Implemented in the Temporal polyfill, WIP in browsers

---

## What's next?

* Temporal intends to ship in browsers soon
* Plan to adopt this before shipping
* Please review the draft and send us your thoughts
* Implementation details not finalized
* Let's adopt this as soon as we can!

# Thanks
