## `DurationFormat` Update ⏲

### Ujjwal Sharma (@ryzokuken)

### TC39 August 2021

## What's up with `DurationFormat`? 🤔

-   Many iterations over design.
-   Sat down and came up with a design that works
    -   Addresses all the edge cases.
    -   Consistent with `DateTimeFormat`.
-   Ironed out all the edge cases.
-   Approved by TC39-TG2.

---

## Introducing the new design 🆕

-   Works similarly to the old design for common edge cases:
    -   Easy to specify base style.
    -   All old styles supported.
    -   `"digital"` works as you'd expect out of the box.
    -   Truncating part of the value still _NOT_ supported (with a catch).

---

## Introducing the new design 🆕

-   New, improved semantics:
    -   Allow unit-specific style akin to `DateTimeFormat`.
    -   Allow per-unit display setting to always display certain units.
    -   Defaults that "just work".
    -   Better support for fractional values.

---

## Example 🔭

```javascript
new Intl.DurationFormat("en").format("P12Y34MT12M34S")
// 12 yr 34 mo 12 min 34 sec
new Intl.DurationFormat("en", { style: "digital" }).format("P12Y24MT12M24S")
// 12 y 34 m 12:34
new Intl.DurationFormat("en", { style: "digital", fractionalDigits: 2 }).format(
    "PT12M34.567S"
)
// 12:34.56
```

---

## Semantics: Highlights 📰

---

### Style 👗

-   There is a _base_ style. This is `"short"` by default.
-   Styles can be customized per-unit.
    -   The default style for any unit is determined by the value of the base style.

---

### Display 🖥️

-   You can configure when to display a particular unit.
    -   All zero units are hidden by default.
    -   When the style is explicitly specified, they are always displayed by default.

---

### Fractions 🔢

-   Consecutive units with the `"numeric"` style can be displayed as a decimal by using `fractionalDigits`.
-   Truncation of the value is not allowed in any way except for the truncation of the least significant bits via `fractionalDigits`.

---

## Progress and Next Steps ⌛

-   Had long sessions to come up with the design and modify it to accomodate all edge-cases.
-   Pitched the design to TG2, took more input and had more deliberations.
-   Spec and explainer updated with the new design.
-   Undergo spec and editorial review and advance to stage 3 next meeting.

## Stage 3 Review 🔍

-   We plan to go for Stage 3 in the next meeting.
-   Current Stage 3 reviewers:
    -   Michael Ficarra [@michaelficarra](https://github.com/michaelficarra)
